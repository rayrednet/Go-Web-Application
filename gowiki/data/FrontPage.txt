👋 Welcome to your Wiki Home Page!

This is the main page of your wiki, your space to organize thoughts, ideas, and knowledge! 🧠✨ 

You can start adding content by clicking the ✏️ "Edit" button above, or explore other pages as you build out your wiki.

To create a new page, just type the page title in the URL bar or link to it within this text like "NewPage". 

For example, visiting `http://localhost:8080/view/ANewPage` will take you to the page edit form. You can enter some text, click "Save," and be redirected to your newly created page! 🎉

Let your imagination and knowledge flow freely! 🌈📚

Happy wiki-ing! 🚀
